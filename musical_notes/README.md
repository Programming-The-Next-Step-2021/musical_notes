# musical_notes
This tool can be used to either learn to read musical notes or to develop pitch memory. 
After installing the package, it can be imported with the 'import musical_notes' command, after which the game can be ran with the musical_notes.game_notes() command.
This will take you to the starting screen of the app.
The app consists of two practice modes and an information screen, all of which can be accessed through the menu at the top left of the window.

The first practice mode is to learn to read notes. It will present images of notes to you, and your job is to type the name of the note in the text box. 
When you click the answer button, your answer will be checked, and you will get feedback. 
If you're wrong, the app will tell you which note was correct so that you can learn from your mistake.
Additionally, the app will keep track of your score for each note. When you guess a note correctly, you will get a +1 score for that note. 
When you guess a note incorrectly, you will get a -1 score for that note.
If you click the "I don't know!" button, the next note will be presented to you without deducting anything from your score. 

As each note is scored separately and the note list contains two full octaves,
the score for the lowest octave note is indicated by just the letter, whereas the score for the higher octave note is indicated by the letter, followed by a 1.
For example, the score for C indicates your score for the lower C, whereas the score for C1 indicates your score for the higher C. Note that the octave doesn't matter for your answer input.

The second practice mode will train you in recognizing the pitch of tones. Instead of presenting images of notes to you, it will present piano sounds. 
After the sound is done playing, your answer box will appear and you can indicate which tone you think it was, in the same way as with the note practice.
Make sure that you only click the answer button once after typing in your answer. 
If you click multiple times before the next note appears, it will record the answer multiple times and also give it as input for following notes!
